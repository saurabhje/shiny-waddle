For the first question, I thought the description was not clarifying enough, I tried to google
for this - from the first read it was obvious I needed to apply some geometric algorithm
not quite sure,
So I googled
Non-intersecting minimization algorithm and i could not find any viable results.

For 2nd question:
This problem could have been better solved with the help of Knapsack using Dynamic programming 
but it was getting extremely verbrose and complex for my own understanding


For 3rd question:
The description was okayish enough, but again lacked the desired output, Like what should
have been the output - The number of paths we can take to satisfy the given conditions,
Number of unique paths, the exact path. 

That's the best I could do with what was given.
